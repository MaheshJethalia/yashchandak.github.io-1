<br>

I'm a third year MS/PhD student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I am also a member of the [Autonomous Learning Lab (ALL)](http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/) and am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/).
My primary interest is in **continual learning**, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, which aims at teaching machines
new concepts over time. My research is mostly at the intersection of reinforcement learning,
optimization, and machine learning. I enjoy reading and looking out for inspirations from neuroscience as well.

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science at [VIT University](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/) in 2017, where [Prof. Nithya Darisini](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2046556969_PS_Nithya_Darisini) was my mentor. I was also fortunate to spend most of my senior year at [IIT-Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) under the guidance of
[Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). In my junior year, I had great learning experiences at the Indian [Defence Research and Development Organization(IRDE, DRDO)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs1/IRDE/English/indexnew.jsp?pg=homepage.jsp)
under Dr. J.P. Singh and later at the [University of Technology, Troyes, France](http://www.utt.fr/en/index.html) under [Prof. Babiga Birregah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHEWWZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).
During my sophomore days, I was introduced to machine learning research by
[Prof. James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/) and [Rajan Vaish](http://www.rajanvaish.com) through [Aspiring Researcher Challenge](https://aspiringresearchers.soe.ucsc.edu/), a large-scale research initiative by professors from the Univ. of California and Stanford.
Before that, I was a national level basketball player in India and used to play all day everyday.
